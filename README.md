I like all things data. I've worked with data my whole career, from things that would fit in a Tweet all the way up to multi-petabyte data warehouses running in the cloud.

Currently, I'm a founder at [SyncWith](https://syncwith.com/). We want anyone to be able to get their data into Google Sheets and Looker Studio.

As a hobby, I'm dabbling with making small datasets much more accessible via SQLite and Datasette plugins.

You can find me on the web at [cldellow.com](https://cldellow.com/) or as [@cldellow on Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io/@cldellow).
