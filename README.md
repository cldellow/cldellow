I like all things data-related.

Professionally, I'm a founder at [SyncWith](https://syncwith.com/). We want anyone to be able to get their data into Google Sheets and Looker Studio.

As a hobby, I like to dabble with Datasette and SQLite.

You can find me on the web at [cldellow.com](https://cldellow.com/) or as [@cldellow on Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io/@cldellow).
